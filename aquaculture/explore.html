        <h1>What Is AquaCulture ?</h1>
        <p>
          Aquaculture is the breeding, rearing, and harvesting of fish,
          shellfish, algae, and other organisms in all types of water
          environments

          As the demand for seafood has increased, technology has made it
          possible to grow food in coastal marine waters and the open ocean.
          Aquaculture is a method used to produce food and other commercial
          products, restore habitat and replenish wild stocks, and rebuild
          populations of threatened and endangered species. <br />

          There are two main types of aquaculture—marine and freshwater. NOAA
          efforts primarily focus on marine aquaculture, which refers to farming
          species that live in the ocean and estuaries. <br />In the United
          States, marine aquaculture produces numerous species including
          oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, seaweeds, and fish such as salmon,
          black sea bass, sablefish, yellowtail, and pompano. There are many
          ways to farm marine shellfish, including “seeding” small shellfish on
          the seafloor or by growing them in bottom or floating cages. Marine
          fish farming is typically done in net pens in the water or in tanks on
          land. <br />
          U.S. freshwater aquaculture produces species such as catfish and
          trout. Freshwater aquaculture primarily takes place in ponds or other
          manmade systems. <br />
          NOAA is committed to supporting an aquaculture industry that is
          economically, environmentally and socially sustainable. NOAA experts
          and partners work to understand the environmental effects of
          aquaculture in different settings and provide best management
          practices to help reduce the risk of negative impacts.
